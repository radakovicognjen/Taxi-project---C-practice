# Taxi-project---C++ - practice

One class would be *Taxi* and the other one would be *Driver*
Classes that inherit Taxi class would be: *Local taxi* & *Intercity taxi*
Logical variables in those classes would check if smoking is allowed, is a taxi pet friendly or not, is it going through highway or not, and other variables would be number of seats etc.
One function would be calculatePrice and it would check if there is discount and then depending on that it would return different values. It also depends on kilometers.
Another function would be addDrive so later we can calculate driver's earnings (also depending on kilometers traveled).
